            I said, "Grandpa, what's this picture here?
            It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
            Is that you there?", he said, "Yeah, I was 11"
            "And times were tough back in '35
            That's me and uncle Joe just tryna survive a cotton farm
            In a great depression"
            If it looks like we were scared to death
            Like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
            You should've seen it in color
            Oh, and this one here's taken overseas
            In the middle of hell in 1943 in the winter time
            You can almost see my breath
            That was my tail gunner ol' Johnny Magee
            He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
            And he had my back right through the day we left
            If it looks like we were scared to death
            Like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
            You should've seen it in color
            A picture's worth a thousand words
            But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
            You should've seen it in color
            This one is my favorite one
            This is me and Grandma in the summer sun
            All dressed up the day we said our vows
            You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
            And <span style="color:red">that rose was red</span> and <span style="color:blue">her eyes were blue</span>
            And just look at that smile, I was so proud
            That's the story of my life
            Right there in black and white
            And if it looks like we were scared to death
            Like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
            You should've seen it in color
            Yeah, a picture's worth a thousand words
            But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
            You should've seen it in color
            (Should've seen it in color)
            Yeah, a picture's worth a thousand words
            But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
            You should've seen it in color
